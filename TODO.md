# Work that needs to be done yet:

## Image Optimization and clean up

Some images used for the development process are no longer referenced.  These can be removed.  Same for some of the font files.

## Hero Navigation

Add page elements to allow navigating next/back on the hero elements.  Add position indicator to know where in the sequence you are - the dots commonly found near the bottom of the rotating items.

The JS file already supports next/previous for navigating through the hero items.
