# Work that needs to be done yet:

## Contact Form Handler

The form is created.  However the backend to handle the form submission is still required.

## Image Optimization and clean up

The images have not yet been optimized for web consumption.

Some images used for the development process are no longer referenced.  These can be removed.  Same for some of the font files.

## Hero Navigation

Add page elements to allow navigating next/back on the hero elements.  Add position indicator to know where in the sequence you are - the dots commonly found near the bottom of the rotating items.

The JS file already supports next/previous for navigating through the hero items.
